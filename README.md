# Assignment2
for class CSC464

I worked on this project as part of a class assignmet. Our goal was to make an ebay like site where customers could log in and buy different products. The products they buy would be stored in that users account and a fake credit card would be charged for every order. 
All the coding for this project was done in eclipse. We used jsp and servlets to pass the data between pages and to the sql database.
